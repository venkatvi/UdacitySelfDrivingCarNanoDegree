This folder contains the UML diagrams associated with the Sensor Fusion Application implemented with Unscented Kalman Filter. 

Folder contains Class Diagrams indicating the relationship between classes. 
It also contains sequence diagrams discussing the overall flow of algorithm. 

The design is SOLID compliant and can be easily extended to a new type of sensor  added to the fusion application.
